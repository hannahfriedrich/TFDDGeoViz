# TFDDGeoViz

## Motives
Create a cleaner, more accessible geovisualization of the Transboundary Freshwater Dispute Database for others to learn about transboundary freshwater characteristics, conflicts, treaties, dams and physical variables like land cover and irrigated areas associated within a basin, basic country unit (BCUs), or country. 


## Brief Description
Utilizing Transboundary Freshwater Dispute Database data, create a geovisualization that is a dynamic, interactive webmap which 
shows basins, BCUs, and countries and a breakdown associated variables with that particular basin, BCU, or country. Primary goal is to express the variables using D3.js on a side panel, which may be expanded to show a comparison of variables between two basins, BCUs, or countries. For the tabluar data (events, RBOs, and treaties), we would like to have a bar beneath the web map that contains rows of the associated event, RBO, or treaties which the user can scroll through. It is also planned to create a network visualization of the events, RBOs, and treaties From this table, one can link to PDFs of the treaties which is hosted by the TFDD group. From the main landing page, one will be able to share, view on Github, and have a link to an "About" page which contains background information on the database, a bibliography, and credits. 

## Data

### Spatial Data: 
Basins
BCUs

## Interface Design 

[World Cloud][] for visualizing a world cloud of words from treaties to demonstrate the verbage which may express positive or negative connotations regarding various treaties.
